I recently graduated from the Australian National University (ANU) with a Bachelor's (Honours) degree in mathematics. At the ANU, I wrote an [honours thesis](https://mike-law.github.io/files/ThesisMCF.pdf) on mean curvature flow under the supervision of [Professor Ben Andrews](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~andrews/). Before doing honours, I completed a BSc at the University of Melbourne.

My current interests are differential geometry, geometric analysis, and analysis more generally.
