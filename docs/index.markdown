I'm a second-year math PhD candidate at MIT, working under Prof. William Minicozzi. I'm working on problems in differential geometry and geometric analysis. Before MIT, I studied at the Australian National University and the University of Melbourne.

# Research

1. Positive mass and Dirac operators on weighted manifolds and smooth metric measure spaces (with Isaac M. Lopez and Daniel Santiago). Preprint, [arxiv:2312.15441](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15441).
<!-- 2. Gapped interpolations between even-spin qAKLT states (with T. Quella and C. Smith). *In preparation.* -->
