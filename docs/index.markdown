I am a mathematics undergraduate at the Australian National University (ANU), graduating in December 2021. My honours thesis on mean curvature flow was supervised by [Professor Ben Andrews](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~andrews/). Before spending my honours year at ANU, I completed a BSc at the University of Melbourne. I intend to enter graduate school in mathematics in Autumn 2022.
