I am a mathematics undergraduate at the Australian National University (ANU), graduating in December 2021. Under the supervision of [Professor Ben Andrews](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~andrews/), I wrote an [honours thesis](https://mike-law.github.io/ThesisMCF.pdf) on mean curvature flow. Before doing honours at ANU, I completed a BSc at the University of Melbourne. I intend to enter graduate school in mathematics in Autumn 2022.
